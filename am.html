<h2>HOME REMEDIES FOR FEVER:</h2>
<p><h3>Cassia:</h3>  Cassia roots are much helpful in treating cold and common fever in ayurvedic treatment. The roots are normally burnt, after which the smoke from them is inhaled for betterment purposes. The mucus discharge, however, is known to increase after such a treatment, which also will stop completely after some time.

</br><h3>Cinnamon:</h3>  Cinnamon, always regarded as beneficial for treatment in common fever in ayurveda, has advised to boil one glass of water together with a pinch of pepper and honey. This lessens the aching throat problems and also bars the cold from turning chronic, or germinating into something severe like pneumonia or influenza.

</br><h3>Cumin seeds:</h3>  Cumin seeds serves an excellent antiseptics, when treating common fever is being spoken about in the ayurvedic world. These seeds thus have beneficial effects if the cold is accompanied with relentless fever. Cumin seeds are also helpful in curing the throat vexations.

</br><h3>Ginger:</h3>  Ginger extracts taken several times a day while suffering from bouts of common fever, serve as excellent remedy for treating coughs that accompany common colds. Ginger tea is also extremely efficacious in treating cough and cold, a much acknowledged recipe in ayurveda since long times.

</br><h3>Onion (Allium cepa):</h3>  The vegetable onion possesses much power and capability to entirely liquefy the phlegm. This makes the sticky mucus much more dilute, as a result of which it gets discharged out from the nose.</p>
<br><br><br><h2>HOME REMEDIES FOR COLD:</h2>
<p><h3>Ginger:</h3>The health benefits of ginger root have been touted for centuries, but now we have scientific proof of its curative properties. A few slices of raw ginger root in boiling water may help soothe a cough or sore throat. Research suggests that it can also ward off the feelings of nausea that so often accompany influenza. For example, one study found that just 1 gram of ginger can “alleviate clinical nausea of diverse causes.”<br>
<h3>Honey:</h3>Honey has a variety of antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. Drinking honey in tea with lemon can ease sore throat pain. Research suggests that honey is an effective cough suppressant, too. In one study, researchers found that giving children 10 grams of honey at bedtime reduced the severity of their cough symptoms. The children reportedly slept more soundly, which also helps reduce cold symptoms.
You should never give honey to a child younger than 1 year old, as it often contains botulinum spores. While they’re usually harmless to older children and adults, infants’ immune systems aren’t able to fight them off.
GARLIC<br>
<h3>Garlic:</h3>Garlic contains the compound allicin, which may have antimicrobial properties. Adding a garlic supplement to your diet might reduce the severity of cold symptoms. According to some research, it might even help you avoid getting sick in the first place.
More research needs to be done on the potential cold-fighting benefits of garlic. In the meantime, adding more garlic to your diet probably won’t hurt.
<br>
<h3>Salt water:</h3>Gargling with salt water may help prevent upper respiratory infections. It may also decrease the severity of cold symptoms. For example, it may ease sore throat pain and nasal congestion.Gargling with salt water reduces and loosens mucus, which contains bacteria and allergens. To try this remedy at home, dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt in a full glass of water. Swish it around your mouth and throat. Then spit it out.<br>
<h3>Warm bath:</h3>Sometimes you can reduce a child’s fever by giving them a warm sponge bath. Warm baths can also reduce cold and flu symptoms in adults. Adding Epsom salt and baking soda to the water can reduce body aches. Adding a few drops of essential oil, such as tea tree, juniper, rosemary, thyme, orange, lavender, or eucalyptus, may also have a soothing effect.<br></p>
<br><br><h2>HOME REMEDIES FOR HEADACHE:</h2>
<p><h3>PepperMint:</h3>Have a mint or drink some peppermint tea, it can really take the edge off!<br>
<h3>Water:</h3> Headaches can be a sign of dehydration. Sometimes drinking a tall glass of pure water is enough to stop a headache in its tracks. Staying hydrated is also a good way to prevent headaches from occurring in the first place. (Note: sometimes it helps to balance water with electrolytes, so adding a little juice and a dash of sea salt to your water can help you achieve balanced hydration.)<br>
<h3>Hot shower:</h3>As with a massage, I’m always up for an excuse to take a hot shower. I always feel more relaxed and rejuvenated afterward, which goes a long way in relieving headache pain. <br>
<h3>Yoga:</h3> The benefits of yoga include improved circulation, relaxation, healthy blood pressure, and heightened neurotransmitter levels. All of these combined make for a great headache remedy.<br>
<h3>A cup of tea:</h3>Not only is a warm cup of tea relaxing, but a tea that uses herbs like peppermint or willow bark can also directly help reduce your headache pain. You can also try chamomile if you tend to have stress/tension headaches. Green tea is also especially helpful, as it contains a small amount of caffeine, which some people find helps with headaches and migraines.<br>
