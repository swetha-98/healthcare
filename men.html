<h1>First Breakfast</h1><br>
<h2>The Foods</h2><br>
<h3>Dairy, eggs, whole grains, and fiber. If you usually skip breakfast, start with a glass of milk or a slice of cheese with whole-wheat toast. Or, if you wake up ready for a meal, have walnut-flaxseed oatmeal with some yogurt and blueberries.
</h3><br>
<h2>The Goal</h2><br>
<h3>To Load up on calories
</h3><br>
<h2>The Rationale</h2><br>
<h3>The protein in milk and other dairy products can increase muscle protein production, helping to promote muscle growth and fat loss after exercise.</h3>
<br><h1>Second Breakfast</h1><br>
<h3>More of the same! That's right—eating twice in the a.m. means you'll take in fewer calories overall. A lot of guys don't have the time (or the stomach) to power down a third of their daily calorie allowance first thing in the morning. So breaking up the meal keeps your calorie intake shifted to the morning while allowing you to start your day without busting a gut.
</h3><br>
<h1>Lunch</h1>
<br><h2>The Foods</h2><br>
<h3>Vegetables, beans, fruits, nuts, and whole grains. Think soups and salads.
</h3>
<br><h2>
The Goal</h2><br>
<h3>To pack in as much as possible</h3>
<br><h2>
The Rationale</h2><br>
<h3>Lunch is the defining moment of your nutritional day. Breakfast is about calorie loading, and by dinner the day is shot. So lunch is your chance to feast on at least three representatives from the fruit, vegetable, or legume category—which is why soups and salads are your go-to choices at this time of day.</h3>
<br><h1>
The Dinner</h1>
<br><h2>
The Foods</h2><br>
<h3>
Leafy greens and other vegetables, lean meats, fish, beans, and legumes.</h3>
