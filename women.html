<h3>Soya beans, soya drinks with added calcium, and tofu (which is made by coagulating soy milk) are both tasty and easy options high in calcium that you can add to your diet.</h3>
<h2>
Dried Fruits</h2>
<h3>Snacking can be tricky, especially when everyone is pressed for time. Instead of reaching out for that quick brownie or cookie, keep dried fruits such as raisins, prunes, figs and dried apricots around!</h3>
<h2>
Try Something Fishy</h2>
<h3>Everyone knows that Vitamin D helps the body absorb more calcium. And while sun remains the most important source of Vitamin D, fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel, and fish liver oil are among </h3>
